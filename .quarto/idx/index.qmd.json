Do the \"simple\" rules governing community assembly fundamentally change as you add more layers of complexity?\n\nThe goal here is to shed some additional light on the question of the importance of pairwise competition/emergent coexistence in microbiomes. Our experiment assembles all possible 2, 3, and 4 species sub communities from a 4-species pool under a gradient of antibiotic concentrations and with different evolutionary histories of the four species. We assess the predictability of community assembly outcomes based on subsets of the reduced species assemblies and attempt to understand whether assembly operates in a predominantly pairwise way.\n\n## Experiment overview\n\n### Background:\n\nIn prior work from our lab we experimentally evolved all species from the HAMBI synthetic community to increasing concentrations of the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin. Briefly, we would grow each species at the highest streptomycin concentration it could tolerate for a number of growth cycles, then we would transfer into a higher streptomycin. We did this until we reached a streptomycin concentration where we could no longer detect growth. Then these cultures were plated and a single clone was isolated.\n\nThese clones are the source \"evolved\" starting materials for this experiment, where their clonal ancestor is the \"ancestral\" starting material.\n\n### Traits and physiology of species:\n\nThe ancestral and evolved form of each species were grown for 48 hours at 30℃ in 100% R2A growth medium [@reasoner1985a] at concentrations of 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096 μg/ml streptomycin. Growth was followed using optical density at 600 nm in a Bioscreen plate reader. Growth rates and carrying capacities were determined from the high resolution growth curves using AMiGA.\n\n### Species interactions:\n\nThe ancestral and evolved forms of each species were grown for 48 hours at 30℃ in 100% R2A growth medium [@reasoner1985a]. Cultures were filtered to remove bacterial biomass and the spent media was stored at 4℃ until use. Next the evolved and ancestral forms of each species were grown in the spent medium of each other evo/anc species for 48 hours at 30℃ and growth was followed using optical density at 600 nm in a Bioscreen plate reader.\n\nFor the Burkholder diffusion assay each species/evolutionary form was added to a soft agar on a petri dish. Then a small volume of each species was pipetted directly onto the agar and plates and checked for zones of inhibition.\n\n### Competition/coexistence outcomes (species proportions from communities):\n\nHere we wish to ensure that any equilibrium coexistence or competitive exclusion between species is not multistable - meaning that the outcome is deterministic and truly based on the density-independent competitive abilities of the species and not dependent on their starting density. The multistability problem has been addressed in other studies by growing each species from each community at different starting densities. This is typically done by starting all of the rare species at a low density and one abundant species at a higher density (as measured by optical density). For more than 2 species you cannot reasonably achieve all possible permutations of different densities, but you can start each species from rare, while leaving one remaining species high.\n\nHere we use starting conditions with 10%/90% for pairs, 80%/10%/10% for trios, and 70%/10%/10%/10% for quartets. For pairs, we alternated so that each species started from rare. For trios and quartets, we alternated so that each species was allowed to invade from rare but we did not use all possible staring proportions due to practical and cost limitations. Another important consideration is that we can not distinguish between the ancestral and evolved forms of the same species with amplicon sequencing (or with plate counts) so that our experimental arrangement cannot be fully factorial (e.g., we cannot compete ancestral 1977 against evolved 1977) and thus there are fewer combinations that one would expect from expected scaling of $2^{(8-1)} = 128$\n\nFor the coexistence/exclusion experiments experimental communities are inoculated in 500 μl of 100% R2A in deep 96 well plates at a 50 fold dilution at four different streptomycin levels: 0, 16, 64, and 256 μg/ml. Plates were incubated in the dark at 30℃ with shaking at 800 RPM. Serial transfers (50 fold dilution; 10 μl to 490 μl) were conducted every 48 hours for a total of eight growth cycles. For every growth cycle $\\mathrm{log_2(50)} \\approx 5.6$ generations will have elapsed for a total of about 45 generations over eight cycles.\n\n## Measurements and data types\n\n### Traits and physiology of species:\n\n-   Growth rates and carrying capacity (in optical density units) of each species (both ancestral/evolved) on a gradient of streptomycin concentrations\n\n### Species interactions:\n\n-   Growth rates and carrying capacity (in optical density units) of each species (both ancestral/evolved) on the filtrate of all other species.\n-   Burkholder Diffusion Assays for species pairs to detect presence of interference competition (e.g., antibiotic or toxin production that kills competitors).
